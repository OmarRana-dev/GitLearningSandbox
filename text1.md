Okay so today my problem related to electricity so in my house I have 2 metres the electricity metres so the problem is on 1 m i Run the entire house electricity and another metre I just run the water pump so the thing is I want to burn only 200 units of electricity so the thing is my electricity consumption is near to 400 Unit so I want to split equally on both metres like 200 and 200 so the problem is some time my unit consumption on one metre is goes up to up to 200 and it will cost me a lot more bill in face of rupees. (if i use 200 units or low it will cost me 20rs per unit but if units comsumptions go up to 200 it will cost me 30rs per unit). so i want to ask u is there any plug like thing with i will put on my main wires and and connect both meters on it and run every meter 15 days like (water pump and home electricity 15days on 1 meter and 15 days on other meter), i want to make it simple and cost effective give me a tool that i will install in my house main electrictiy wires and split the days on both meters
